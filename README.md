# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-Subtype

This was a final project in my machine learning techniques course. The objective was to predict the histological subtype
and progesterone status of a patient's breast cancer based on genetic markers. I used several techniques such as CART,
random forests, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM). A secondary objective was to
accurately predict the two aforementioned variables using only 50 predictors (i.e. 50 genes) out of the 1936 available.

This project includes the final report as well as the R code to generate it (RMarkdown, as well as embedded scripts ran
in R chunks)
